# Memoflow

Author: Stefano Rutishauser

Since I work for an agency with the short name "Memo" I dedicate that workflow to my colleagues.

## Introduction

This workflow is based on the following parameter:
- working on OSX
- development of full Shopware 5 PE project for a client
- working as a team (two or more) on one project
- local development with MariaDB, Apache, DNSMasq installed via Homebrew
- local end-to-end testing with Cypress
- deployment with Capistrano (Ruby)
- live / stage environment (subfolder Solution)

## Requirements

To follow that guide I recommend checking the requirements:
- working local environment
- preferred code editor installed
- Live hosting environment with SSH connection
- empty project repository
- familiar with basic Git commands
- familiar with basic Shell commands
- Ruby installed (mostly on OSX)
